- The value of the name-letter heh is 10 (heh-heh) as the number of the Sephiroth, and it means window. The Sephiroth are like the windows of a house, which allow light to enter. These windows are colored, and the white Light of God, passing through them, divides into a prism of colors. These windows are both the way the Divine essence manifests itself in the universe and the way we can know God.
- The theosophical extension of 10 is 55, which is like juxtaposing two heh, two windows. Reason, in fact, is the ability to connect elements together. Indeed, 2 is the number of the High Priestess and implies communication and association. Reason projects a contextual network of ideas and orders them within a logical fabric.
-The theosophical extension of 4 is 10. The number 10 returns with all its implications, one of which is that it is the number of Malkuth and the Wheel of Fortune. 10 is also the result of the sum of 7 and 3, numbers constituting the value in gematria of Chokmah (73). Chokmah is joined to Tiphareth by the very Constitutive Intelligence, the path of The Emperor. He sits on a stone, ehben, union of father (ab, Chokmah) and son (ben, Tiphareth). Tiphareth's gematria value, 1081, also reduces theosophically to 10.
- Chokmah is the 2nd Sephirah, Tiphareth the 6th. These two numbers side by side give 26, the numerical value of YHVH. The cube on which The Emperor is seated is itself symbolic of YHVH, since the sum of the angles, lines and faces of the cube results in 26.
- These suggestions indicate that underlying the 10 numerations is a rational Logos. The Kingdom of Malkuth is the domain of this ruler.
- The dress of The Emperor is armor with purple fronds. The armor indicates that the identity of The Emperor is impenetrable. The purple shows that his covering, his body, is represented by the Universe in its perspective as a universal mechanism supported by divine laws. It is through vision that God gives structure to the fabric of the universe and keeps it alive. We can participate in this creative act and share with God His vision, but we cannot look into the eye and comprehend the ineffable Self, which is Ain Soph. The Emperor is linked to the symbolism of Mars, of which he is the magical image. Mars is associated with Geburah, which is madim, the Sphere of Mars. Geburah means Strength, and a name of The Emperor, related to strength, is adon, The Strong One, which also means the owner, the lord, the ruler, and is spelled aleph-daleth-vav-nun, with value 61. 61 is also the value of ain, the last negative veil of existence. Anagramming ain we derive ani, which is the personal pronoun I. The identity behind this ruler is none other than ain, the nothingness that is such because it is the great removed of sensible experience.
- A connection between the number 10, 55 and Nothingness is given to us by the Sepher Yetzirah (1:3):

*"Ten Sephiroth of Nothingness
   in the number of ten fingers
   five opposite to five ".*

- The sky behind The Emperor is orange. Orange is the color of The Lovers. Discrimination is indeed the basis of the exercise of reason and definition. To define something, one must know how to isolate it from everything else.
- The Emperor also teaches us a powerful method of concentration for entering into relationship with the divine powers. He looks at The Empress, or mental images. When we visualize something we are engraving images on the screen of the mind. This engraving work according to Kabbalah is called chakikah. At the same time, however, concentration requires a parallel operation, called chavitzà, which means cutting. We must, in fact, remove from our mental field everything that is foreign to the element on which we are concentrating. These two operations are possible because of the power of vision (chakiká), which projects the concentrated power of superconsciousness, and the power of discrimination (chavitzá), which helps us clear the field of everything that is irrelevant. The act of concentration is suggested to us not only by the fact that, as PFC reminds us, The Emperor is The Magician but in a different guise, but also by the fact that he seems to be looking into the circle that sits atop his scepter, a symbol of concentration, similar almost to a focusing lens.
- The sphere held in his left hand shows an interesting paradox. We see an inverted tav and, towering over it, a cross, also related to the meaning of the name-letter tav. The tav, symbolically related to Saturn, indicates the limiting power and material appearances of the spirit. The fact that one of the tavs is upside down and one emerging above it suggests that when we can turn appearances upside down we glimpse a world behind the world, a world regulated by a punctual and rational intelligence, the Administrative Intelligence that perfectly coordinates the Universe according to a vital dance. This perfection is suggested to us by the orange sky, the color of Hod, the Perfect Intelligence (saykel shalom). Shalom also means peace, and in fact the experience connected with tav and key 21, The World, is that of Cosmic Consciousness and Deep Peace.
