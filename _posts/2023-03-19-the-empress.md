- Daleth value is 4. 1+2+3+4 = 10, Malkuth.
- The 7 pearls and her being Nogah, the sphere of Venus, tell us the Empress is also Netzach, the desire nature.
- The red triangle is a symbol for Tejas, the principle of fire, which is also the power behind vision, the active power of imagination.
- Dalet, as a letter-name, has value 434, like the word מימד רקמ which means womb. We notice, in fact, that the Empress is pregnant.
- In her right hand she holds a heart with a dove descending upon it. The dove is spirit. The heart has value 32 in hebrew (leb), like the 32 paths of wisdom. It is an act of Godly imagination that keeps the world running and perfuses it with the spirit of love. This is a golden rule to have success in our visualizations too: imagining something and pervading it with emotions.
- 434 is also the value of a word meaning scroll, like the one held by the High Priestess. Associated with the 14th path (14 = David, the loved one), the Empress joins Chokmah to Binah. She's pregnant with the Light of Chokmah (the twelve stars on her head representing Chokmah as Masloth, the sphere of the zodiac), and she's about to give birth to form when descending into Binah. She's Aima, the Bright Mother, and her offspring will be the world of forms. She depicts the actualization of the names written in the scroll of the High Priestess, and this is further represented by the fact that the Torah (HP's scroll) begins with beth (2) and ends with lamed (30), meaning that the Law is a Law of Love, and that the principle behind form is a loving one.
