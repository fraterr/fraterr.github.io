- There are 7 lilies on the right minister's back, only 4 of which are visible. The lilies represent knowledge. Intuition shows us a glimpse of Divine vision (4 visible lilies, the Emperor). The additional three lilies we add with our work of reworking the received intuition. The result is dominion over circumstances, victory (4+3=7) as well as the formulation in language of knowledge.
- The heads of ministers are shaved. For intuition to be produced in our minds, we must clear them of preconceptions and expectations.
- Our organ of knowledge is the brain (the right minister), whereas our organ of emotion is the heart (left minister). The right minister joins his hands, signifying the joining of the two brain hemispheres. This harmonisation results in communing with God's Wisdom. The left minister stretches his hand toward the silver key, which is the key to Sheol, or the Astral World. When this double alignment is prepared, we are ready to receive the Guide from Within. There is, in fact, in deep meditation, a moment when the heart seems to bloom like a rose, and radiates a magnetic essence toward the brain, synchronising it. 
- Intuition is a process which is always at work. Whenever we focus our attention on something outside (the Emperor) there is a part of us which automatically streams the inner significance of what we're focusing upon. Not always we are receptive to it, but when we are, we get to really know the world around us.
- 5 = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. This is the value of Yah, the Divine Name attributed to Chokmah(Wisdom), and of Hod(Intellect), the 8th Sephirah.
 8 is also the number of Strength, and Leo, the zodiac sign linked to the heart. The non-verbal knowledge of Chokmah is an energy that nurtures our heart and intellect that translate it in knowledge, emotions and, eventually, deeds.
