- On the two pillars are engraved the letters beth and yod, value of 2 and 10 respectively. The sum is 12, as:
  1.a. The name-letter vav, meaning nail.
  2.a. abyss.
  3.a. lost thing.
  4.a. desire, lust, longing.
  5.a. being silent.
  6.a. fish.
- The theosophical extension of 12 is 78, as:
  1.b. to dream.
  2.b. to be white.
  3.b. to carry.
- Mem is the 12th letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
- 1.a. Neshamah, associated with Binah and the High Priestess is said to be the source of intuition; hence the connection with vav and the Hierophant.
- 2.a. Binah can be compared to Prakriti, the subconscious ocean over which the Divine Spirit floated in the Cosmogony of biblical Genesis.
- 3.a. this particular appellation links the High Priestess to Satan. How? The three letters that make up the name "Satan" are Shin, 20, Teth, 8, Nun, 13, the sum of which gives 41, which is the value of the word "mother," one of the appellations of Binah, the Cosmic Mother. The extension of 20 is 210, as "being unsearchable." A lost thing (3.a.) is an unsearchable thing. The subconscious as long as it is such remains uncaught because it is beyond the jurisdiction of consciousness.
- 4.a. Desire is the force behind duality, and the eternal chasing of the two poles that want to unite; moreover, the path of wisdom of the High High Priestess is called Unifying Intelligence.
- 5.a. Silence is the precondition for getting in touch with the Universal Soul. One must "hang" like the Hanged Man to experience the state of consciousness associated with mem.
- 6.a. the fish connects to nun and the seminal power present in Yesod, which, in humans, is reflected physically in the libido, which is an application of it. Yesod is the Sphere of the Moon, symbolism connected to the High Priestess.
- 1.b. When Adam is split, and light is given to Eve, he is preliminarily placed in a state of torpor/sleep. From the moment duality is born, the cosmic dream, the universal drama, begins.
- 2.b. The color white is linked, through its Hebrew name laban, to the moon, which is lebanah, or laban joined to the letter heh. The moon is associated with the High Priestess and Yesod. The color white is a reference to purity, and in fact Yesod is called the Purifying Intelligence.
- 3.b. As the camel, the High Priestess carries the burden of memory, of impressions upon which conscious attention has indulged. The subconscious is the support of the world.
